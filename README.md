# PortusSophia™ Governance Repository

This repository contains the governance layer of the PortusSophia™ architecture.  
It defines **standards, procedures, metadata rules, stewardship workflows, UICH formats, classification systems, and compliance artifacts**.

## Purpose
The Governance layer provides the structural and procedural backbone of PortusSophia™.  
It ensures:
- boundary discipline  
- version control and traceability  
- artifact classification  
- stewardship accountability  
- standards evolution under controlled processes  

## Contents
- PS-STD-* standards  
- UICH templates  
- governance manifests  
- metadata rules  
- compliance directives  
- stewardship guidelines  
- structural review procedures  

## What Does NOT Belong Here
- Canonical doctrine (belongs in `portussophia-canon`)  
- Public interpretive content or WebKernel scaffolding  
- Narrative or private materials  
- Runtime code or execution logic (belongs in `portussophia-kernel`)  

## Notes
All artifacts must follow:
- PS-STD-001 (UICH)
- PS-STD-060 (Governance Documentation Standard)
- PS-STD-100 (Metadata Integrity Standard)
