# Universal Informational Content Header (UICH)

## Overview

The Universal Informational Content Header (UICH) is a standardized metadata framework for PortusSophia™ content files. It ensures consistent identification, classification, and management of all project artifacts.

## Purpose

UICH provides:

- Consistent metadata structure across all content
- Clear identification and versioning
- Stewardship and ownership tracking
- Classification and categorization
- Compliance verification

## Scope

UICH applies to:

- Governance documents
- Standard definitions
- Workflow specifications
- Compliance artifacts
- Template files

UICH does **not** apply to:

- Build artifacts
- Temporary files
- Binary assets (unless specifically required)
- External dependencies

## Structure

See `SPECIFICATION.md` for the complete UICH format specification.

See `TEMPLATE.md` for ready-to-use UICH templates.

## Compliance

All governance documents must include a valid UICH header. Use the compliance checklist in `/compliance` to verify UICH conformance.
