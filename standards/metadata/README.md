# Metadata Standards

## Overview

Metadata standards define the structure, format, and validation rules for descriptive information attached to PortusSophia™ content and artifacts.

## Purpose

Consistent metadata enables:

- Effective content discovery and search
- Automated classification and organization
- Version control and change tracking
- Relationship mapping between artifacts
- Compliance and audit trails

## Metadata Categories

### Structural Metadata
Information about document structure and format (defined in UICH)

### Descriptive Metadata
Content categorization, keywords, and classification

### Administrative Metadata
Ownership, stewardship, and access control

### Technical Metadata
Format specifications, dependencies, and requirements

## Standards Documents

- `SCHEMA.md` — Core metadata schema definition
- `VALIDATION.md` — Validation rules and requirements
- `EXAMPLES.md` — Practical metadata examples

## Relationship to UICH

UICH (Universal Informational Content Header) is the primary metadata framework. Additional metadata standards extend UICH for specific use cases.

## Compliance

All governance artifacts must conform to applicable metadata standards. See `/compliance` for validation checklists.
